A mysqueezebox.com client for the Nokia N900

I used this mainly to listen to Napster, but now that it has been taken over by Rhapsody the streams are no longer accessible, so it no longer works. I am leaving this here in the slim chance someone wants a reference to a PySide (Qt) program using Phonon on the N900.
